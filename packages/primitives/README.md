# `@naos-ui/primitives`

`@naos-ui/primitives` is the first Naos-authored primitive component package.
The components are written as `.wc.tsx` modules and compiled to native Custom
Elements for distribution.

**Stability: experimental.** Pre-1.0 and under active design; component APIs
may change in any release.

```ts
import "@naos-ui/primitives"
```

Or import individual elements:

```ts
import "@naos-ui/primitives/button"
import "@naos-ui/primitives/toggle"
```

## Contracts

The primitives expose platform-readable contracts:

* `part` names for styling hooks.
* `data-state`, `data-disabled`, `data-invalid`, and `data-orientation`.
* Overlay hooks such as `data-naos-overlay`, `data-modal`, `data-side`,
  `data-align`, `data-anchor-hidden`, and `data-layer` where applicable.
* Presence hooks such as `data-naos-presence`, `data-starting-style`, and
  `data-ending-style` where transient UI owns enter/exit timing.
* CSS custom properties with `--naos-*` names.
* Native ARIA attributes where the current `.wc.tsx` compiler surface supports them.
* Naos-prefixed `CustomEvent`s such as `naos-change`, `naos-select`, and
  `naos-press`.

Checkbox, combobox, date picker, editable, file upload, listbox, number input, pin input, radio group,
rating group, segmented control, slider, select, switch, tags input, toggle, and toggle group use the compiler-owned `formControl()` spike to generate
Form-Associated Custom Element output. They support `name`, `value`, submit,
reset, disabled fieldset propagation, and `FormData` in the current MVP, but
remain experimental until label association, validation, and broader
cross-browser coverage are complete.

Shared behavior lives in private package modules under `src/internal`. Simple
kernels remain under `src/internal/behavior`; Zag-backed adapters live under
`src/internal/zag`. Compound primitives can use the package-private
`context-request` helper for DOM-native child registration without a framework
runtime or public context API. Overlay primitives share a package-private
`overlay` helper for state attributes, geometry variable names, Escape routing,
outside-interaction classification, and layer stack ownership. Transient UI can
use the package-private `presence` helper for entering/open/closing/closed
phase attributes and animation-aware close teardown. They are intentionally not
public exports.

## Typed Elements

Every primitive ships a generated declaration file next to its module: the
element class with typed properties, typed `addEventListener` overloads for
its `CustomEvent` payloads, and a global `HTMLElementTagNameMap` entry. In a
TypeScript consumer, `document.createElement("naos-toggle")` and
`querySelector("naos-toggle")` return `NaosToggleElement`, assigning a
mistyped prop is a compile error, and `naos-change` listeners receive
`CustomEvent<{ pressed: boolean }>`.
