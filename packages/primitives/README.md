# `@iktia/primitives`

`@iktia/primitives` is the first Iktia-authored primitive component package.
The components are written as `.wc.tsx` modules and compiled to native Custom
Elements for distribution.

```ts
import "@iktia/primitives"
```

Or import individual elements:

```ts
import "@iktia/primitives/button"
import "@iktia/primitives/toggle"
```

## First Components

| Element | Purpose | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<iktia-button>` | Shadow-DOM action button with slots, variants, parts, and `iktia-press`. | Experimental |
| `<iktia-button-group>` | Oriented grouping for action controls. | Experimental |
| `<iktia-checkbox>` | ARIA checkbox primitive with checked, indeterminate, and native `FormData` behavior. | Experimental form-associated MVP |
| `<iktia-dropdown>` | Button-triggered dropdown/disclosure primitive. | Experimental |
| `<iktia-field>` | Field composition shell for labels, controls, hints, and errors. | Experimental |
| `<iktia-radio-group>` / `<iktia-radio>` | Zag-backed radio collection with roving focus and native `FormData` behavior. | Experimental form-associated MVP |
| `<iktia-tabs>` | Platform-style tab set for three slotted panels. | Experimental |
| `<iktia-toggle>` | Pressed/on-off button primitive with native `FormData` behavior. | Experimental form-associated MVP |

## Contracts

The primitives expose platform-readable contracts:

* `part` names for styling hooks.
* `data-state`, `data-disabled`, `data-invalid`, and `data-orientation`.
* CSS custom properties with `--iktia-*` names.
* Native ARIA attributes where the current `.wc.tsx` compiler surface supports them.
* Iktia-prefixed `CustomEvent`s such as `iktia-change` and `iktia-press`.

Checkbox, radio group, and toggle use the compiler-owned `formControl()` spike
to generate Form-Associated Custom Element output. They support `name`,
`value`, submit, reset, disabled fieldset propagation, and `FormData` in the
current MVP, but remain experimental until label association, validation, and
broader cross-browser coverage are complete.

Shared behavior lives in private package modules under `src/internal`. Simple
kernels remain under `src/internal/behavior`; Zag-backed adapters live under
`src/internal/zag`. They are intentionally not public exports.
