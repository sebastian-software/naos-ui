# CLI

`@iktia/cli` publishes the `iktia` binary. It is a thin command-line surface
over the same native compiler API used by `@iktia/vite`.

## Commands

```sh
iktia compile <input> [-o output] [--stdout]
iktia prerender <input> [-o output] [--props json]
iktia info
```

`compile` transforms one `.wc.tsx` module and writes JavaScript. With `-o`, the
CLI also writes a sibling `.map` file when the compiler returns a source map.
Without `-o`, compiled JavaScript is printed to stdout.

`prerender` emits Declarative Shadow DOM host HTML through the explicit
prerender path. `--props` must be a JSON object. CSS uses the same flat
`?inline` import convention as Vite, and the CLI resolves those CSS files before
calling the native prerender workflow.

`info` prints Node platform metadata and native compiler version metadata as
JSON.

## Diagnostics

Compiler failures are rendered from structured `diagnostics[]` entries:

```txt
counter.wc.tsx:4-12 error IKTIA_UNSUPPORTED_SYNTAX: Unsupported JSX
hint: Use supported syntax.
```

The CLI exits with status `1` when compilation or prerendering fails.
