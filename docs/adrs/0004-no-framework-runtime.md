# ADR 0004: No Framework Runtime

Status: Accepted

Weight: P0

## Context

lean-wc is inspired by React, Solid, Signals, Remix v3, and Web Component
libraries, but the project exists to compile TSX authoring into native elements.
Shipping another framework runtime would weaken that position.

## Decision

Generated components must not depend on React, Solid, Remix, Preact, Lit,
Stencil, or a virtual DOM runtime. Small generated helpers are allowed when they
implement platform-facing behavior such as scheduling, attribute conversion,
event dispatch, style injection, and lifecycle cleanup.

## Alternatives

* Wrap a Solid or Preact component in a Custom Element.
* Generate LitElement subclasses.
* Ship a lean-wc runtime that performs reconciliation in the browser.

## Consequences

* The compiler must emit direct DOM and Custom Element code.
* Runtime helpers must remain small and inspectable.
* Framework-like features need explicit compiler support.
* Compatibility with framework ecosystems happens through native Web Components,
  not runtime adapters.
