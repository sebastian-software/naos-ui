## `@iktia/core`

| Export | Stability | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `state(initialValue)` | Public | Writable local component state. |
| `computed(() => value)` | Public | Read-only derived value. |
| `effect(() => cleanup?)` | Public | Lifecycle-aware side effect with optional cleanup. |
| `event<Detail>(name)` | Public | Typed `CustomEvent` dispatcher. |
| `on(name, handler, options?)` | Public | Typed DOM listener helper with invocation-scoped abort signals. |
| `host()` | Public | Current element, root, props, lifecycle signals, and update/task handle. |
| `Show` | Public | Explicit conditional control-flow primitive. |
| `Switch` | Public | First-match-wins multi-way control-flow primitive. |
| `Match` | Public | Static branch arm for `<Switch>`, with optional trailing default. |
| `For` | Public | Item-keyed list control-flow primitive. |
| `Index` | Public | Position-keyed list control-flow primitive with item accessors. |
| `ComponentOptions` | Public | Component-level `styles` metadata. |
| `ElementRef` | Public | JSX `ref` variable or callback type for direct element access. |

Authoring primitives are compile-time APIs. They throw if a `.wc.tsx` module is
executed without the compiler transform.

Generated `state.set()` and `state.update()` calls are batched into a microtask.
Use `host().flushSync()` when a handler must observe the updated DOM
immediately after changing state. `host().update()` requests a batched update
and resolves to an `AbortSignal` for work tied to that update pass.

## `@iktia/data`

| Export | Stability | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fetchResource(key, fetcher, options?)` | Experimental | Create an abortable, cached, stale-while-revalidate resource from a fetcher. |
| `subscriptionResource(key, subscriber, options?)` | Experimental | Create a ref-counted resource from a push subscription source. |
| `ResourceCache` | Experimental | Scope resource cache, in-flight fetches, and active subscriptions. |
| `defaultResourceCache` | Experimental | Shared default cache for simple apps. |
| `normalizeResourceKey(key)` | Experimental | Convert string, tuple, or object keys into stable cache keys. |

`null`, `undefined`, and `false` keys disable a resource. Fetchers receive an
`AbortSignal`; equivalent in-flight keys are deduped; cached data is retained as
stale while revalidation runs. Subscription resources share equivalent upstream
subscriptions until the final consumer is disposed.
`@iktia/data` intentionally has no provider SDK dependencies; provider-specific
adapters such as Convex should live in separate optional packages.

See [Data Resources](data.md) for examples and the Convex adapter direction.

## `@iktia/data-convex`

| Export | Stability | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `convexResource(client, query, args, options?)` | Experimental | Create a resource from a Convex WebSocket query subscription. |
| `convexMutation(client, mutation, options?)` | Experimental | Create a typed Convex mutation caller. |
| `convexAction(client, action)` | Experimental | Create a typed Convex action caller. |
| `convexConnectionResource(client, options?)` | Experimental | Create a resource from Convex connection state. |
| `convexQueryKey(query, args)` | Experimental | Create the stable `@iktia/data` cache key for a Convex query. |

`@iktia/data-convex` depends on `@iktia/data` and declares `convex` as a peer
dependency. It should be installed only by apps that use Convex.

## `@iktia/compiler`

```ts
type TransformComponentRequest = {
  filename: string
  source: string
}

type TransformComponentResult = {
  code: string
  hasChanged: boolean
  map?: SourceMap
}

type RenderDeclarativeShadowDomRequest = {
  filename: string
  source: string
  props?: Record<string, unknown>
  inlineStyles?: Record<string, string>
}
```

Compiler failures throw `IktiaCompilerError` with structured `diagnostics[]`.
Diagnostics include code, severity, message, filename, optional span, and
optional hint.

## `@iktia/vite`

`iktia(options)` transforms accepted `.wc.tsx` modules and emits prerender
metadata by default for static HTML workflows. Set `prerender: false` only for
builds that never need Declarative Shadow DOM metadata.

## `@iktia/router`

`createRouter(options)` creates an optional browser-side router for Custom
Element app shells. It maps route records to native element tags or explicit
element factories, lazy-loads route modules, runs abortable route `loader`
hooks, handles explicit `data-iktia-action` forms through route `action` hooks,
exposes `iktiaRoute` with params, search params, loader data, action data, URL,
navigation type, and `AbortSignal`, intercepts same-origin anchors, updates
active-link attributes, and mounts not-found or error routes.

```ts
const routes = defineRoutes([
  { path: "/", tag: "app-home" },
  {
    path: "/products/:id",
    tag: "app-product",
    loader: ({ params }) => fetch(`/api/products/${params.id}`).then((response) => response.json()),
    action: ({ formData }) => saveProduct(formData),
  },
])
```

The package has no React, Lit, Vaadin Router, TanStack Router, or Waku runtime
dependency and is not used by generated components unless an app imports it. It
does not own application caching, sessions, cookies, SSR, or backend routing.

## `@iktia/cli`

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `iktia compile <input>` | Transform one `.wc.tsx` module to JavaScript. |
| `iktia prerender <input>` | Emit Declarative Shadow DOM host HTML. |
| `iktia info` | Print platform and native compiler metadata. |

See [CLI](cli.md) for options and examples.
